## In Progress Tasks

### 🚧 bootstrap/feat/instrumentation-hook-bus
**Started**: Not yet started  
**Assigned**: TBD  
**Blockers**: None  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must be completed first

**Next steps**:
1. Create src/mcp_agent/core/instrument.py with hook bus
2. Add _emit() calls to Agent.call_tool, Workflow.run, AugmentedLLM.generate
3. Write unit tests proving <70ns overhead
4. Validate against instrumentation-hooks.md contract

### 🚧 bootstrap/feat/gateway-health-endpoint
**Started**: Not yet started  
**Assigned**: TBD  
**Blockers**: None  

**Next steps**:
1. Implement full gateway.py with Starlette router
2. Add health endpoint
3. Implement standalone server mode
4. Write unit tests

## Pending Tasks

### ⏳ bootstrap/feat/telemetry-span-attributes
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: Blocked by instrumentation-hook-bus  
**Estimated effort**: 2-4 hours

### ⏳ bootstrap/feat/ui-react-scaffold  
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: Blocked by gateway-health-endpoint  
**Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours

### ⏳ bootstrap/ci/github-actions-setup
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: Blocked by other tasks  
**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

## Metrics

- **Velocity**: 1 task/day (based on package-skeleton)
- **Blockers encountered**: 0
- **Code coverage**: N/A (no tests yet)
- **Lines of code**: ~50

## Risks & Issues

1. **Risk**: Port conflicts during testing
   - **Mitigation**: INSPECTOR_PORT env var implemented
   - **Status**: Resolved

2. **Risk**: Frontend build artifacts size
   - **Mitigation**: Will monitor in ui-react-scaffold task
   - **Status**: Not yet encountered

## Notes for Next Session

- **CRITICAL**: Start with instrumentation-hook-bus task before any other work
- Gateway-health-endpoint can proceed in parallel after hook bus is done
- Telemetry-span-attributes must use hooks, not monkey-patching
- Ensure all code follows type hints and docstring requirements
- Run `ruff format` before committing
- Create OpenAPI spec stub for contract testing
