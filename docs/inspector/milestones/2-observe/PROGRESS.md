# Milestone 2-observe: Progress Tracker

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-13  
**Overall Progress**: 46% (6/13 tasks completed)  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Blocked By**: None (1-bootstrap complete)  
**Current Focus**: observe/feat/ui-session-navigator (Phase 1)

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ observe/feat/sessions-unified-list
**Completed**: 2025-07-13 (during 1-bootstrap)  
**Commit**: Part of `feat(sessions): implement session listing and SSE event streaming`  

**What was done**:
- Implemented in sessions.py to list all trace files from ~/.mcp_traces/
- Extracts metadata including status, start/end times, engine type
- Returns unified format as specified
- Graceful degradation for Temporal already built in

**Deviations from plan**: 
- Completed earlier than planned as part of bootstrap infrastructure
- InMemoryWorkflowRegistry integration deferred to later

**Lessons learned**: Session listing was simpler than expected, mainly file scanning

### ✅ observe/feat/trace-file-exporter  
**Completed**: 2025-07-13 (during 1-bootstrap)  
**Commit**: Part of `feat(inspector): create InspectorFileSpanExporter with gzip support`

**What was done**:
- InspectorFileSpanExporter writes gzipped JSONL to ~/.mcp_traces/{session_id}.jsonl.gz
- Properly expands ~ in paths
- Integrates with Inspector context system for session ID
- File rotation support at configured size limits

**Deviations from plan**:
- HTTP endpoint for streaming traces not yet implemented
- Range header support deferred

**Lessons learned**: gzip.open() in append mode works perfectly for incremental writes

### ✅ observe/feat/events-sse-stream
**Completed**: 2025-07-13 (during 1-bootstrap)  
**Commit**: Part of `feat(sessions): implement session listing and SSE event streaming`

**What was done**:
- Full SSE implementation in events.py with EventStream class
- Common event types implemented: SessionStarted, SessionFinished, WaitingOnSignal, Heartbeat
- Monotonic event counter and client management
- Gateway endpoint at /_inspector/events

**Deviations from plan**:
- AsyncEventBus integration not yet complete (manual event publishing for now)
- Ring buffer for event replay not implemented yet

**Lessons learned**: SSE implementation is straightforward with Starlette's EventSourceResponse

---

### ✅ observe/fix/async-event-bus-init
**Completed**: 2025-07-13  
**Commit**: `fix(logging): add queue existence checks to AsyncEventBus`

**What was done**:
- Added `hasattr(self, '_queue')` checks in stop() method
- Added safety check in _process_events() method
- Fixed `AttributeError: 'AsyncEventBus' object has no attribute '_queue'`
- Ensures graceful handling when stop() is called before start()

**Deviations from plan**: None

**Lessons learned**: 
- The issue was that _queue is only initialized in start() via init_queue()
- Defensive programming with hasattr checks prevents crashes
- Circular import in logging module made testing challenging

## Execution Order (Following Optimized Plan)

### Phase 1: Enable Live Data (Current)

4. **observe/feat/telemetry-full-enrichment**
5. **Simple span tree viewer** (part of UI)

### Phase 3: Validate & Enhance
6. **observe/test/e2e-playwright-suite**
7. **observe/feat/workflow-pause-signals**
8. **observe/feat/sessions-inbound-mcp** + **inbound-rpc-instrumentation**

### Phase 4: Polish
9. **observe/test/performance-baseline**
10. **observe/docs/hook-integration** + **api-reference-stubs**

## In Progress Tasks

(None currently)

## Pending Tasks

### ⏳ observe/test/performance-baseline
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours

### ⏳ observe/docs/hook-integration
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

### ⏳ observe/feat/telemetry-full-enrichment
**Status**: Partially complete  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours remaining
**Notes**: Span enrichment subscribers already implemented in 1-bootstrap. Need to add resource/prompt hooks.

### ⏳ observe/feat/sessions-inbound-mcp
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: sessions-unified-list (✅)  
**Estimated effort**: 4-5 hours

### ⏳ observe/feat/inbound-rpc-instrumentation
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours
**Notes**: Added as new task to complement outbound RPC instrumentation

### ⏳ observe/feat/workflow-pause-signals
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: events-sse-stream (✅)  
**Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours

### ⏳ observe/feat/ui-session-navigator
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: Multiple backend tasks (3/5 complete)  
**Estimated effort**: 8-10 hours

### ⏳ observe/docs/api-reference-stubs
**Status**: Partially complete
**Dependencies**: Most implementation complete  
**Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours remaining
**Notes**: OpenAPI spec already exists at docs/inspector/openapi.yaml

### ✅ observe/feat/trace-streaming-endpoint
**Completed**: 2025-07-13  
**Commit**: `feat(trace): implement trace streaming endpoint with hybrid compression`  

**What was done**:
- Created trace_stream.py with full streaming functionality
- Hybrid approach: gzipped for full files, decompressed for Range requests
- Robust security validation with path canonicalization
- ETag support for efficient caching
- Added endpoint to gateway.py at /trace/{session_id}
- Comprehensive test suite (11 tests, all passing)
- Demo script showing the functionality

**Deviations from plan**: None

**Lessons learned**: 
- TestClient auto-decompresses gzipped responses, needed special handling in tests
- URL-encoded path traversal attempts need decoding before validation
- Streaming decompression with byte ranges requires careful chunk boundary handling

---

### ✅ observe/feat/workflow-event-emission
**Completed**: 2025-07-13  
**Commit**: `feat(inspector): implement workflow event emission via hooks`  

**What was done**:
- Added SessionRegistry class to track active sessions and manage heartbeats
- Implemented session event subscribers that convert workflow hooks to SSE events
- Created comprehensive test suite with 6 tests covering all scenarios
- Registered session subscribers in the hook system
- Verified workflow hooks are already emitted by Workflow.run_async()

**Technical approach**:
- Leveraged existing hook system (instrument._emit) as per architectural guidance
- Non-blocking event publishing using asyncio.create_task
- Time-based heartbeat strategy with separate background tasks
- Graceful handling of missing session IDs and AsyncEventBus failures

**Deviations from plan**: None

**Lessons learned**:
- Workflow lifecycle hooks were already implemented in the core
- Hook-based architecture made integration straightforward
- Test fixtures need proper async handling with pytest_asyncio

### ⏳ observe/test/e2e-playwright-suite
**Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: UI complete  
**Estimated effort**: 4-5 hours

## Metrics

- **Total estimated effort**: 23-35 hours remaining (was 27-39 hours)
- **Tasks added**: 4 (fix/async-event-bus-init ✅, feat/inbound-rpc-instrumentation, feat/trace-streaming-endpoint ✅, feat/workflow-event-emission ✅)
- **Total tasks**: 13 (was 11)
- **Completed**: 6/13 (46%)
- **Velocity**: ~4 tasks/day based on bootstrap milestone
- **Blockers encountered**: 1 (AsyncEventBus initialization - now fixed)
- **Code coverage**: 80% for inspector module (increased with new tests)

## Risks & Issues

1. **Risk**: Temporal integration complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation if Temporal unavailable
   - **Status**: Not yet encountered

2. **Risk**: Large trace file performance
   - **Mitigation**: Streaming with Range support
   - **Status**: Not yet encountered

3. **Risk**: SSE connection stability
   - **Mitigation**: Auto-reconnect with event replay
   - **Status**: Not yet encountered

## Notes for Implementation

- Start with backend tasks in parallel where possible
- UI task blocked until at least 3 backend tasks complete
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain <1ms span overhead target
