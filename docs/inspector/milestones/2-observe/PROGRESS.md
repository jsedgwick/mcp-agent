# Milestone 2-observe: Progress Tracker

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-13  
**Overall Progress**: 31% (4/13 tasks completed)  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Blocked By**: None (1-bootstrap 92% complete)

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ observe/feat/sessions-unified-list
**Completed**: 2025-07-13 (during 1-bootstrap)  
**Commit**: Part of `feat(sessions): implement session listing and SSE event streaming`  

**What was done**:
- Implemented in sessions.py to list all trace files from ~/.mcp_traces/
- Extracts metadata including status, start/end times, engine type
- Returns unified format as specified
- Graceful degradation for Temporal already built in

**Deviations from plan**: 
- Completed earlier than planned as part of bootstrap infrastructure
- InMemoryWorkflowRegistry integration deferred to later

**Lessons learned**: Session listing was simpler than expected, mainly file scanning

### ✅ observe/feat/trace-file-exporter  
**Completed**: 2025-07-13 (during 1-bootstrap)  
**Commit**: Part of `feat(inspector): create InspectorFileSpanExporter with gzip support`

**What was done**:
- InspectorFileSpanExporter writes gzipped JSONL to ~/.mcp_traces/{session_id}.jsonl.gz
- Properly expands ~ in paths
- Integrates with Inspector context system for session ID
- File rotation support at configured size limits

**Deviations from plan**:
- HTTP endpoint for streaming traces not yet implemented
- Range header support deferred

**Lessons learned**: gzip.open() in append mode works perfectly for incremental writes

### ✅ observe/feat/events-sse-stream
**Completed**: 2025-07-13 (during 1-bootstrap)  
**Commit**: Part of `feat(sessions): implement session listing and SSE event streaming`

**What was done**:
- Full SSE implementation in events.py with EventStream class
- Common event types implemented: SessionStarted, SessionFinished, WaitingOnSignal, Heartbeat
- Monotonic event counter and client management
- Gateway endpoint at /_inspector/events

**Deviations from plan**:
- AsyncEventBus integration not yet complete (manual event publishing for now)
- Ring buffer for event replay not implemented yet

**Lessons learned**: SSE implementation is straightforward with Starlette's EventSourceResponse

---

### ✅ observe/fix/async-event-bus-init
**Completed**: 2025-07-13  
**Commit**: `fix(logging): add queue existence checks to AsyncEventBus`

**What was done**:
- Added `hasattr(self, '_queue')` checks in stop() method
- Added safety check in _process_events() method
- Fixed `AttributeError: 'AsyncEventBus' object has no attribute '_queue'`
- Ensures graceful handling when stop() is called before start()

**Deviations from plan**: None

**Lessons learned**: 
- The issue was that _queue is only initialized in start() via init_queue()
- Defensive programming with hasattr checks prevents crashes
- Circular import in logging module made testing challenging

## Metrics

- **Total estimated effort**: 29-42 hours remaining (was 38-51 hours)
- **Tasks added**: 4 (fix/async-event-bus-init ✅, feat/inbound-rpc-instrumentation, feat/trace-streaming-endpoint, feat/workflow-event-emission)
- **Total tasks**: 13 (was 11)
- **Completed**: 4/13 (31%)
- **Velocity**: ~4 tasks/day based on bootstrap milestone
- **Blockers encountered**: 1 (AsyncEventBus initialization - now fixed)
- **Code coverage**: 78% for inspector module

## Risks & Issues

1. **Risk**: Temporal integration complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation if Temporal unavailable
   - **Status**: Not yet encountered

2. **Risk**: Large trace file performance
   - **Mitigation**: Streaming with Range support
   - **Status**: Not yet encountered

3. **Risk**: SSE connection stability
   - **Mitigation**: Auto-reconnect with event replay
   - **Status**: Not yet encountered

## Notes for Implementation

- Start with backend tasks in parallel where possible
- UI task blocked until at least 3 backend tasks complete
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain <1ms span overhead target
